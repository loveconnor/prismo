# Java Support Added to Prismo Code Editor

## Summary
Java compilation and execution support has been successfully added to both the backend and frontend.

## Changes Made

### Backend (`backend/app/claude_routes.py`)
1. ✅ Added `execute_java_code()` function that:
   - Extracts the public class name from Java code using regex
   - Compiles Java code using `javac`
   - Executes compiled code using `java` command
   - Handles compilation errors and runtime errors
   - Cleans up temporary files after execution

2. ✅ Updated language validation to include `"java"`

3. ✅ Updated code execution logic to route Java code to the new executor

4. ✅ Updated test case runner to support Java

### Frontend

#### CodeMirror Editor (`src/components/widgets/coding/code-editor/code-editor.ts`)
1. ✅ Installed `@codemirror/lang-java` package
2. ✅ Imported Java language support
3. ✅ Added Java case in `getLanguageSupport()` method for syntax highlighting and autocomplete

#### Monaco Editor (`src/components/widgets/coding/editor-panel/editor-panel.ts`)
1. ✅ Updated supported languages list to include `'java'`
2. ✅ Monaco Editor has built-in Java support, no additional configuration needed

## Supported Languages
The code editor now supports:
- ✅ JavaScript/JS
- ✅ Python/Py
- ✅ C++/CPP
- ✅ Java (NEW!)

## Requirements
To run Java code, the server must have:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (includes `javac` compiler)
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) included in JDK

**Note:** Currently, the server has JRE but not JDK. To enable Java execution:
```bash
# Install JDK (example for macOS)
brew install openjdk

# Or download from: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
```

## Testing
A test script has been created at `backend/test_java_execution.py` to verify Java execution.

To test:
1. Ensure JDK is installed: `javac -version`
2. Start the backend server
3. Run: `python3 backend/test_java_execution.py`

## Java Code Examples
Your existing Java modules will now work with the code editor:
- `coding---java-ada94bbc.json`
- `coding---java-e5f9cef1.json`
- `coding---java-640fda73.json`
- And many more!

Example Java code that can now be executed:
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello from Java!");
        int sum = 5 + 10;
        System.out.println("5 + 10 = " + sum);
    }
}
```

## Features
- ✅ Syntax highlighting for Java
- ✅ Autocomplete support for Java
- ✅ Compilation error reporting
- ✅ Runtime error handling
- ✅ Test case execution
- ✅ Execution time tracking
- ✅ Output capture
